We require to develop an API for e-learning courses to integrate in our system. The purpose of this tool is for us, as professors to manage courses configuration and performance reviews and, for our students, to take courses when using our frontend. Our PM is a very busy person, so we don’t have detailed tasks but only the business rules to work with. Here they are:

Instrucciones

We have courses that contain lessons and lessons that contain questions

The courses are correlative with previous ones

The lessons are correlative with previous ones

The questions for each lesson have no correlation

All questions for a lesson are mandatory

Each question has a score

Each lesson has an approval score that has to be met by the sum of correctly answered questions to approve it

A course is approved when all lessons are passed.

There’s no restriction on accessing approved courses

Only professors can create and manage courses, lessons and questions

Any student can take a course

Initially, we’ll need to support these types of questions:

    Boolean
    Multiple choice where only one answer is correct
    Multiple choice where more than one answer is correct
    Multiple choice where more than one answer is correct and all of them must be answered correctly

Frontend guys specifically asked for these endpoints for the students to use:


    Get a list of all courses, telling which ones the student can access
    Get lessons for a course, telling which ones the student can access
    Get lesson details for answering its questions
    Take a lesson (to avoid several requests, they asked to send all answers in one go)
    Basic CRUD for courses, lessons and questions

The API must be developed using Python

There must be a readme file documenting installation and usage.

You can use any frameworks and libraries you want, but they must be included in the readme file documenting its purpose and a brief explanation with the reasoning for your choice.
